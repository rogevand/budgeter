budgeter notes:

this program is meant to replace an excel spreadsheet for creating and
tracking budget items.
I will do this by creating a database of transaction entries.
the end goal is to automate this process using ajax
need total monthly amount
need categories for transactions
need calculators for how much i have spent and how much I can 
need calculator for statistics, such as percent of months within set budget
need models and calculator for monthly static expenses 
need calculator for goals
 date amount categories
